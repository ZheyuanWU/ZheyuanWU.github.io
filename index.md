Hey! 

I'm a computer science bachelor student at [Saarland University], and I'm on a journey to discover my research passions. I'm broadly interested in these topics: 
language design,
program analysis, 
formal methods in security, 
testing and verification
.

<!-- I enjoy learning new abstract theories at university and would like to find more motivation through practice. So I am currently looking for a student job in coding, for any ideas or information please feel free to [email me] :D -->
