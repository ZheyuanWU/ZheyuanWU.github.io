###### Thanks for curiosity and interest :)

### Photography
Memories, Emotions, and Who I Am.
<!-- Photography for me is a record of emotions. I have always been overly concerned with some of the trivial details of life that are full of beauty, so I rely on my intuition to record them.  
I never care about devices, for me a mobile phone is the best choice. -->

### And something I love and would recommend ...
Films : The French Dispatch
A book of short stories: Opowiadania bizarne (“Tales of the Bizarre”), by Olga Tokarczuk
Games: Disco Elysium
Anime: 進撃の巨人 (Attack on Titan)

<!-- ### Cooking and tasting delicacies
For me food is one of the most important things in life and cooking it myself or going to a restaurant is both great. I prefer Asian food, but I'm very open to new tasting experiences.  
todo:  
I plan to put some of my usual recipes here, as well as some restaurant recommendations (mainly in Saarbrücken) -->


### Design
I've had an interest in design before, especially collage, see some of the [projects](https://wuzheyuanper.wixsite.com/home) I've made.
