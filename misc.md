### Links on academic life
- A real PhD story. A weird use case that turned out to work: if your family has no clue what PhD life is like, give them this book :p [The Ph.D. Grind: A Ph.D. Student Memoir](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/15731248-the-ph-d-grind)

- Uses the “Four Children” from the Passover Haggadah to frame how we present our work to different kinds of audiences, very insightful. Other articles by Herr Dreyer are also worth reading :) [Herr Dreyer - On the Four Children](https://herrdreyer.wordpress.com/2014/12/08/on-the-four-children-part-1-afikomen-vs-teeth-blunting/)

- A course designed to help new PhD students clarify common misconceptions and find their own rhythm. [CS290: How to Make the Most of Your PhD](https://harvard-cs290-2025-26.github.io/)

- My first programming classes at Saarland University were built around these two textbooks. They shaped how I think about programming, still my go-to when I need to reset my brain. They’re not very well-known outside Saarland, so leaving them here for whoever’s curious.
    - [Introduction to Functional Programming (with OCaml)](https://www.ps.uni-saarland.de/~smolka/drafts/prog2021.pdf)
    - [Introduction to Imperative Programming (with RISC-V, C, Java)](https://prog2.de/book/preface.html)
    - other great textbooks I encountered at saarland: 
        - [concurrent programming (pseuCo)](https://book.pseuco.com/#/)
        - [the fuzzing book](https://www.fuzzingbook.org/beta/index.html)
        - [the debugging book](https://www.debuggingbook.org/)
