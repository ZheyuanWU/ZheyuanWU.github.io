### [🗓️](LifeCalendar/index.html)

### Photography
📷 [Photos](photos.html) about Memories, Emotions, and Who I Am
<!-- Photography for me is a record of emotions. I have always been overly concerned with some of the trivial details of life that are full of beauty, so I rely on my intuition to record them.  
I never care about devices, for me a mobile phone is the best choice. -->


### Something I love and would recommend ...
📽️ Film : The French Dispatch    
📖 Book : Opowiadania bizarne (“Tales of the Bizarre”), by Olga Tokarczuk    
🎮 Game: Disco Elysium    
🎴 Anime: 進撃の巨人 (Attack on Titan)    

<!-- ### Cooking and tasting delicacies
For me food is one of the most important things in life and cooking it myself or going to a restaurant is both great. I prefer Asian food, but I'm very open to new tasting experiences.  
todo:  
I plan to put some of my usual recipes here, as well as some restaurant recommendations (mainly in Saarbrücken) -->

### Design
I've had an interest in design before, especially collage, see some of the [projects](https://wuzheyuanper.wixsite.com/home) I've made.
